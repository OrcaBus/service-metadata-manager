# Metadata Manager Service

## Overview

The root of the project is an AWS CDK project where the main application logic lives inside the `./metadata-manager` folder.

View Metadata Manager application logic README [here](./metadata-manager/README.md).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key directories:

- **`./app`**: Contains the main application logic. You can open the code editor directly in this folder, and the application should run independently.

- **`./bin/deploy.ts`**: Serves as the entry point of the application.

- **`./infrastructure`**: Contains the infrastructure code for the project:
  - **`./infrastructure/toolchain`**: Includes stacks for the stateless and stateful resources deployed in the toolchain account. These stacks primarily set up the CodePipeline for cross-environment deployments.
  - **`./infrastructure/stage`**: Defines the stage stacks for different environments:
    - **`./infrastructure/stage/config.ts`**: Contains environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `beta`, `gamma`, `prod`).
    - **`./infrastructure/stage/stack.ts`**: The CDK stack entry point for provisioning resources required by the application in `./app`.

- **`.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml`**: Configures GitHub Actions to run tests for `make check` (linting and code style), tests defined in `./test`, and `make test` for the `./metadata-manager` directory.

- **`./test`**: Contains tests for CDK code compliance against `cdk-nag`. You should modify these test files to match the resources defined in the `./infrastructure` folder.

## Setup

### Requirements

```sh
node --version
v22.9.0

# Update Corepack (if necessary, as per pnpm documentation)
npm install --global corepack@latest

# Enable Corepack to use pnpm
corepack enable pnpm

```

### Install Dependencies

To install all required dependencies, run:

```sh
make install
```

### CDK Commands

You can access CDK commands using the `pnpm` wrapper script.

This template provides two types of CDK entry points: `cdk-stateless`.

- **`cdk-stateless`**: Used to deploy stacks containing stateless resources (e.g., AWS Lambda), which can be easily redeployed without side effects.

The type of stack to deploy is determined by the context set in the `./bin/deploy.ts` file. This ensures the correct stack is executed based on the provided context.

For example:

```sh
# Deploy a stateless stack
pnpm cdk-stateless <command>
```

### Stacks

This CDK project manages multiple stacks. The root stack (the only one that does not include `DeploymentPipeline` in its stack ID) is deployed in the toolchain account and sets up a CodePipeline for cross-environment deployments to `beta`, `gamma`, and `prod`.

To list all available stacks, run:

```sh
pnpm cdk-stateless ls
```


## Linting and Formatting

### Run Checks

To run linting and formatting checks on the root project, use:

```sh
make check
```

### Fix Issues

To automatically fix issues with ESLint and Prettier, run:

```sh
make fix
```
