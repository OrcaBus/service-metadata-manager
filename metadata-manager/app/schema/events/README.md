# Event Schema Models

This directory contains Python models generated from JSON schemas.

- The Makefile in this directory uses JSON schemas located in the repository's `docs` root to generate Python model files.
- All Python files here are auto-generated

Refer to the JSON schema files in `../../../../docs/events/` for schema definitions.
